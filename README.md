## About the Video Course
Unity, available in free and pro versions, is one of the most popular third-party game engines available. It is a cross-platform game engine, making it easy to write your game once and then port it to PC, consoles, and even the web, making it a great choice for both indie and AAA developers. 
This video course begins by building custom weapons with custom meshes and behaviors in a UFPS framework. You will then learn how to create different encounters for effective gameplay scenarios. You will also learn how to create unique moving objects the player can interact with. Finally, you will learn to create a custom GUI to help your game stand out from the rest. By the end of the course, you will have built an amazing FPS game with a stunning GUI, created an installer, and packaged your game for release.
